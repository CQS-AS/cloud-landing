        h2.header-1 How much bandwidth do I need?
        p Thanks to the power of CloudSync technology, engagement files are downloaded once to your local PC and thereafter only the changes made are synced to the Cloud thereby utilizing minimal bandwidth whilst always ensuring your files are up-to-date.
